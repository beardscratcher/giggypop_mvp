# [GiggyPOP Landing Page](http://giggypop.co/)

[GiggyPOP](http://giggypop.co/) is a startup trying to make going to gigs as stress free as possible by matching preexisting friends with gigs they both want to see.

It heavily leans on [Start Bootstraps - Grayscale](http://startbootstrap.com/template-overviews/grayscale/) theme but modified to be a bit more colourful. 

Start Bootstrap is based on the [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com/) framework created by [Mark Otto](https://twitter.com/mdo) and [Jacob Thorton](https://twitter.com/fat).
